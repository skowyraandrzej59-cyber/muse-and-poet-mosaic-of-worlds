🎨 3. Why This Work Is a “Musical / Symphony”

Creativity never moves in a straight line.
It comes in waves: clarity, darkness, conflict, beauty, rupture, love.

This work uses:

musical theatre → for characters, scenes, human drama

symphony structure → for emotional cycles and the inner journey

Instead of one narrative: five emotional landscapes.
Instead of linear plot: a symphonic path of the Poet’s soul.

💬 4. Artist Statement

Art is a journey toward an inner light—through chaos, silence, memory and beauty.
The Muse is not a woman; she is the returning light.
The Poet is each of us.
The work ends without a final chord because life itself never closes perfectly.

Final Song of the Poet — Two Canonical Performance Variants

The project contains two officially approved versions of the Poet’s final song:

1. The Extended Version (Version 2 — “Long Form”)

A broad, symphonic reading of the finale, suitable for:

large stages,

concert performances,

expanded orchestral scoring,

productions emphasizing metaphysical scale.

It preserves the full poetic arc and allows the music to unfold with depth and dramatic patience.
This version conveys the cosmic dimension of the Poet’s journey — a finale not only of a man, but of an idea.

2. The Shortened Version (Version 2 — “Stage Finale”)

A concise, highly concentrated lyrical form, designed for:

dramatic stage productions,

mюsical-theatre pacing,

narrative clarity,

emotional purity,

moments where music must “breathe” and carry the meaning.

This version is considered the canonical finale for theatrical use.
It preserves the essence of the Poet’s arc while offering a clear, resonant, and musically balanced ending.

⭐ Why the Final Song Must Be Performed by a Female Voice (Artistic Rationale)

The decision to use a female vocalist — instead of the Poet’s own voice — is not incidental.
It represents one of the core metaphysical insights of the project:

**The final words of the Poet are spoken not by the Poet,

but by his Muse.**

This artistic choice is justified by several layers:

1. Symbolic Meaning

The Muse becomes the voice of what survives the Poet:

inspiration,

memory,

inner truth,

the eternal source of his art.

It is not a woman speaking —
it is Poetry itself.

2. Dramaturgical Impact

By the end of the mюsical, the Poet has exhausted his earthly voice.
The Muse completes his arc, delivering:

the clarity he gained only by parting,

the transformation of sorrow into creation,

the acceptance of inspiration as a “sweet, poisoned cup.”

Her singing finalizes his journey.

3. Musical Logic

A female voice provides:

clarity,

purity of timbre,

a sense of transcendence,

lightness over the harmonic texture.

It elevates the finale from personal confession to universal statement.

4. Cultural Resonance

The artistic tradition of the Russian romance and Pushkinian lyricism often anchors the metaphysical voice in the feminine —
as the whisper of destiny, the breath of inspiration, the echo of the heart’s highest truth.

Thus, a female voice becomes not a character,
but a timeless vessel.

⭐ Conclusion

Both versions of the finale (long and short) remain part of the official score.
However:

→ The Shortened Version 2 is the canonical theatrical finale.
→ The final song must be performed by a female voice, representing the Muse.

This dual structure strengthens the flexibility, artistic depth, and future adaptability of the entire project.
