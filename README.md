🎨 3. Why This Work Is a “Musical / Symphony”

Creativity never moves in a straight line.
It comes in waves: clarity, darkness, conflict, beauty, rupture, love.

This work uses:

musical theatre → for characters, scenes, human drama

symphony structure → for emotional cycles and the inner journey

Instead of one narrative: five emotional landscapes.
Instead of linear plot: a symphonic path of the Poet’s soul.

💬 4. Artist Statement

Art is a journey toward an inner light—through chaos, silence, memory and beauty.
The Muse is not a woman; she is the returning light.
The Poet is each of us.
The work ends without a final chord because life itself never closes perfectly.
