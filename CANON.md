# CANON.md  
### *Muse and Poet: Mosaic of Worlds*  
### **Canonical Declaration**

This document defines the immutable core of the musical/symphony project.  
All creative work MUST follow the rules below. No new elements may be added without explicit approval from the Author.

---

## 1. Core Characters

- **The Poet** — the central consciousness, the narrative and emotional axis.  
- **The Muse** — a metaphysical, non-physical presence; voice of inspiration, not a human character.

### Not included in the musical:
- No Wife  
- No family members  
- No domestic or everyday characters  
- No comic relief or secondary cast  
- No literal antagonists  

Only **Poet** and **Muse** exist as active forces in the dramatic space.

---

## 2. Core Dramatic Principles

- The musical is metaphysical, lyrical, symbolic — **not realistic and not domestic**.  
- The story unfolds in inner, cosmic and poetic spaces, not in everyday life.  
- The Muse never appears as a concrete woman; she is a voice, echo, presence, archetype.  
- The Poet’s journey is internal: transformation through sorrow, inspiration, and metaphysical awakening.

---

## 3. Musical/Dramatic Structure (Confirmed Parts)

1. **Prologue** — introduction to the Poet's world and the presence of the Muse.  
2. **Interlude (Night / Threshold)** — transition between reality and the inner world.  
3. **Transformation Ritual / Vision Scenes** — metaphysical experiences of the Poet.  
4. **Bled Vision** — one of the core emotional sequences.  
5. **Paris — Starlight in My Wine** — a symbolic world-fragment.  
6. **Finale (Short)** — canonical stage ending, performed by a **female voice (Muse)**.  
7. **Finale (Long)** — symphonic/concert version of the ending.

No additional scenes may be inserted without approval.

---

## 4. Musical Casting Rules

- **The final song is ALWAYS performed by a female voice** (the Muse).  
- The Poet’s voice may appear in earlier scenes, but the finale belongs exclusively to the Muse.  
- No male–female duets representing “family,” “marriage,” or “domestic relationships.”

---

## 5. Canonical Themes

These themes define the philosophical identity of the musical:

- Inspiration as “sweet poison”  
- Distance as clarity  
- Night as creative threshold  
- Fire and fading light  
- Transformation through loss  
- Metaphysical journey, not a plot  
- Poetry as salvation  
- The Muse as eternal feminine principle

Any proposed creative material must be consistent with these themes.

---

## 6. Forbidden Elements

- No literal realism or everyday domestic dialogues  
- No children, parents, spouses  
- No humor that breaks tone  
- No technological, political, or mundane references  
- No narrative arcs unrelated to the Poet’s inner journey  
- No replacement of Muse with a human character  

---

## 7. Rules for Collaboration with AI

- The AI must work **strictly within this CANON.md**.  
- The AI must NOT introduce new characters, scenes, or concepts.  
- Before generating any scene or song, the AI must:
  1. Summarize what is being requested  
  2. Confirm alignment with CANON.md  
  3. Ask for approval before writing the text
